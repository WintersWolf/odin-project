# Recipe Site
Lesson Link: [Foundations Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

This project is part of the foundations curriculum of The Odin Project. It acts as an introduction to HTML and involves developing a recipe site purely with HTML (no css styling etc). The site should include a list of recipes with links to those recipes each on their own page with an image.
