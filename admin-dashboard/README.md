This admin dashboard project is an exercise in HTML & CSS to create a (non-functioning) admin dashboard from a provided design. Deciding to deviate a little from the provided design, while still maintaining all of the required elements, I went for a dark mode design for a fictional admin dashboard I called Nook.
