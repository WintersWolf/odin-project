As in introduction to basic JavaScript concepts, this project requires creating a Rock Paper Scissors game written in JavaScript that can be played against a very basic AI opponent that randomly chooses a play. As an extra task, using HTML & CSS the project requires a visual page and UI for the user to interact with.
