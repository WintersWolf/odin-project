Essentially a twist on the popular to-do list, this project requires users to create a web app that allows users to track books in their library. They should be able to add and remove books from the list, with information about the title, author, pages and an indication of whether or not the book has been read.

The project is built with HTML and CSS for the structure and styling, with JavaScript for the functionality. I decided to use local storage to save the users books to enable persistence across sessions.
