The goal for this project was to create a weather app with JavaScript that utilizes the OpenWeather API ( https://openweathermap.org/ ). Using the API users should be able to search for any city worldwide and receive up-to-date weather information in both celcius and farenheit.

For this project I wanted to create a design that felt like a live dashboard. As an additional exercise in working with APIs, I also decided to use the data from OpenWeather API to populate hourly forecast charts with CanvasJS.
